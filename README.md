Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to showcase my HTML knowledge in creating the HTML Boilerplate, working with lists and several other HTML elements, and linking multiple HTML webpages via both absolute and relative paths. I will be creating this project in VScode and using git within the Command Line Interface (CLI) to commit changes and push my work to my remote repository on GitHub.
